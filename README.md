# Net-Revenue-Management-NRM-Case-Study-FMCG-Commercial-Strategy-Model

Executive Summary

This project analyzes revenue growth and margin optimization opportunities within an FMCG shampoo category using Net Revenue Management (NRM) principles. The objective was to identify structural profitability levers across pricing, mix, trade investment, and promotional strategy.
Through multi-dimensional KPI analysis (market share, YTD growth, MAT, gross margin, portfolio mix), the model quantifies where revenue is being diluted and where margin expansion opportunities exist.
The analysis demonstrates how structured revenue diagnostics can uncover growth buckets that materially improve profitability without requiring volume expansion.

Financial & Strategic Framing

This project evaluates:
•	Margin contribution by product mix
•	Net sales impact from pricing architecture
•	Trade investment efficiency
•	Promotional return potential
•	Forecasted revenue uplift from NRM initiatives

Key commercial insight:
Revenue growth without margin discipline erodes profitability. Strategic price-pack architecture and mix optimisation can improve net revenue without increasing operational complexity.
This project demonstrates cross-industry application of pricing and revenue optimisation frameworks.


Overview
This project simulates the role of a Category Manager at Healthmax, an FMCG company operating in the shampoo market. The objective was to conduct a full commercial performance analysis and build a Net Revenue Management (NRM) strategy to drive profitable growth.
The analysis moves beyond reporting KPIs and into structured commercial decision-making across pricing, portfolio optimisation, trade investments, and revenue forecasting.

🧠 Strategic Framework Applied
The project was structured around the 5 pillars of Net Revenue Management:
1.	Brand Portfolio Pricing
2.	Mix Management
3.	Trade Terms Management
4.	Price Pack Architecture
5.	Promotion Management
Each pillar was translated into an analytical model in Excel to simulate real commercial decision-making.
